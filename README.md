# Social Network Backend

## Description

This project is to help me familiarize myself with mongoDB as a back end while keeping in good practice for the file structure. The user should be able to add delet and edit the users and thoughts collections as well as the reactions subdocument in thoughts. The thoughts also can belong to a user as well and should be rendered when you get the user if the user has any associated thoughts.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository on your computer.
2. Navigate to your cloned repository in your terminal.
3. Use the command `npm i` in the terminal to install the dependencies.
4. Use command `npm start` in the terminal to launch your backend.
5. Open insomnia (or a similar application) to test the paths that should now be open using `http://localhost:3001/api/(rest of your call)`

## Usage

You can add users thoughts and reactions as well as associate thoughts with the different users. If this had a front end with a sign in this would be able to have users login and friend other users they know. The users would also be able to post their thoughts as well as react to other users posted thoughts.
